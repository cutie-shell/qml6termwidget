Description: Terminal Widget QML module
 This project is a QML port of qtermwidget. It is written to be as close
 as possible to the upstream project in order to make cooperation
 possible.
 .
 At the moment this plugin is powering cool-retro-term and the
 lomiri-terminal-app.
 .
 This package contains the QML module and also a simple test application.
